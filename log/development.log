AbstractController::ActionNotFound (The update action could not be found for the :set_listing
callback on ListingsController, but it is listed in the controller's

Raising for missing callback actions is a new default in Rails 7.1, if you'd
like to turn this off you can delete the option from the environment configurations
or set `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions` to `false`.

Raising for missing callback actions is a new default in Rails 7.1, if you'd

The floors were a little dirty, as our feet definitely collected dust and crumbs but nothing that was a turn off. The hot tub was a great add! It needed up being really cold but we sucked it up to get out and soak up the views of the city, which the kids loved. Another perk for them was the Ms PAC Man game! The kitchen was modern and had all the necessary items for some basic cooking needs. The Keurig was a hit for my husband and I with creamer and lots of coffee choices to use. We did not walk as we had a car and the garage was great to not have to worry about parking. It was tight and took some getting used to with an SUV but a car would have no problem. Cory sent us birthday doughnuts that the kids just loved! 10/10!!"], ["date", "2024-12-02"], ["airbnb_review_id", "1103002765272318360"], ["listing_id", 1], ["created_at", "2024-12-02 19:46:16.028004"], ["updated_at", "2024-12-02 19:46:16.028004"]]

The beds were comfortable (a huge plus!); the kitchen was appropriately stocked. There was plenty of space to spread out.\nSome things that could be improved upon would be that it would be great if there were hand towels available. (We had no hand towels even in the kitchen.) A few things were in disrepair (a couple of broken toilet seats, multiple light bulbs out, etc.)\nOverall we had a great stay though. Cory was an incredible host (the best I've had so far) and was great about responding to questions and even brought us donuts one morning, which was a huge surprise.\nIn conclusion, I would recommend this property."], ["date", "2024-12-03"], ["airbnb_review_id", "726815230417889464"], ["listing_id", 1], ["created_at", "2024-12-03 12:19:15.746263"], ["updated_at", "2024-12-03 12:19:15.746263"]]
